# Architectural Decision Log

<!--
  This file records significant architectural decisions.

  PURPOSE: Capture the WHY behind decisions so that:
  - You remember in 6 months why something was done
  - The AI doesn't re-propose rejected approaches
  - New team members understand the context

  Add new decisions at the TOP of the log.
  Use the ADR (Architectural Decision Record) format below.
