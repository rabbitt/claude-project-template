# Coding Conventions

## Style Guide

<!-- Specify the canonical style guide for your language -->

We follow [STYLE GUIDE NAME](link) enforced by tooling.

## Tool Configuration

| Tool | Purpose | Config Location |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| [linter] | Linting | `[config file]` |
| [formatter] | Formatting | `[config file]` |
| [type checker] | Type checking | `[config file]` |

**Check the config files** - they ARE the conventions. The AI should read these to understand project-specific rules.

**Before committing:**
```bash
[lint command] && [format check command]
```

## Project-Specific Conventions

<!--
Document ONLY:
- Deviations from the standard style guide
- Project-specific patterns not covered by tooling
- Architectural patterns (service layer, repository pattern, etc.)

If it's enforced by your linter/formatter, don't repeat it here.

[Add your project-specific conventions here]
