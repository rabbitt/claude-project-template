# [Project Name] - Development Context

<!--
  This file is the AI's "memory" for your project. Keep it CONCISE.

  Detailed reference material belongs in separate files:
  - Coding conventions → docs/reference/CONVENTIONS.md
  - Build commands → docs/reference/BUILD.md
  - Project structure → docs/reference/STRUCTURE.md
  - Architecture decisions → docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md
-->

## Project Overview

<!-- USER: Fill this in once, update rarely -->

[2-3 paragraphs describing:]
- What the project does
- Key technologies/frameworks
- High-level architecture
- Target users/use cases

## Critical Startup Instructions

<!-- USER: Set up once, update when adding new required files -->

**MANDATORY: Read these files at the start of EVERY session:**

1. `docs/process/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md` - Development process
2. `docs/process/FEATURE_PLAN.md` - Current feature roadmap
3. `docs/process/TANGENT_TASKS.md` - Outstanding tangents
4. `docs/process/SESSION_LOG.md` - Recent session history

**Reference as needed:**
- `docs/reference/CONVENTIONS.md` - Coding patterns
- `docs/reference/BUILD.md` - Build, test, run commands
- `docs/reference/STRUCTURE.md` - Project file organization
- `docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decision log

## Critical Rules

<!-- USER: Define these, AI must follow them -->

### ALWAYS:
- Follow the 9-step feature workflow
- Document tangents instead of pursuing them
- Get explicit approval before merging
- [Add project-specific rules]

### NEVER:
- Merge without user review and approval
- Pursue tangents without documenting them first
- Make architectural changes without documenting the decision
- [Add project-specific rules]
