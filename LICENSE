CLARIFICATION OF INTENT:

This template is licensed under CC-BY-4.0 for redistribution and derivative
works. If you fork this template, create a derivative template, or redistribute

However, no attribution is required when using these files as configuration
in your own projects. Think of this like a compiler or build tool - you don't
credit the tool in your output. Copying CLAUDE.md and the docs/ structure into
your project to use this workflow does not require attribution.

In short:
- Forking/redistributing the template itself → Attribution required
- Using the template files in your own project → No attribution needed
